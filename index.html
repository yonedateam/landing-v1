        <p>
          In the golden age of software development, speed was the heartbeat, and innovation was the lifeblood. A
          culture that
          revered problem-solving and relished challenges. Failure was not feared but embraced as a stepping stone to
          improvement.
          Developers had the freedom to iterate rapidly, learning from mistakes and continuously refining their craft.
        </p>

        <p>
          Software development was well-oiled machine, finely tuned to foster innovation. Developers were not just
          writing code;
          they were shaping the future of technology. The industry moved at the speed of thought, and the only
          limitations were
          the boundaries of one's creativity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fast forward to the present, where we witness a line of talented developers idly waiting for their turn to
          staging
          environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          We settled for mediocrity when we accepted this as the new norm. The thrill of pushing boundaries has been
          replaced by
          the agony of waiting, and the once-pulsating heartbeat of speed has been muted by the maze of processes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The culprit is not the developers—the brilliant minds tirelessly crafting lines of code—it's the labyrinth
          of
          processes
          that have sprouted like weeds, entangling us in a web of complexity. The very complexity that was meant to
          streamline
          has now become the stumbling block, choking the life out of our creativity.
        </p>
